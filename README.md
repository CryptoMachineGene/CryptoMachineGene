# 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene McGrath  
**Blockchain Developer | Educator | Consultant | Writer | Researcher | Co-Founder of New World Cryptos® | U.S. Army Veteran**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack blockchain developer, writer, and researcher focused on decentralized infrastructure, smart contracts, and financial sovereignty.

As Co-Founder of New World Cryptos® — launched in 2021 and registered with the USPTO in 2024 — I co-lead a dual-platform initiative for blockchain education and Web3 innovation. While I now lead development and research, the platform’s architecture and brand identity were built by my partner and co-founder, The Decentralized Dreamer, who designed both sites from the ground up.

We operate two core platforms:

- 🧠 [**NewWorldCryptos.io**](https://newworldcryptos.io) – A self-hosted Ghost publication for dev logs, crypto research, and sovereign signal
- 🌐 [**NewWorldCryptos.com**](https://www.newworldcryptos.com) - Our official domain, currently redirecting to our Mighty Networks–powered community hub (paused; relaunch in progress)

I work hands-on with Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, Node.js, Rust/Anchor, REACT/REDUX and related tooling — blending code with market research to publish high-context insights for sovereign builders.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 Current Focus

 - Building Solidity-based projects (ERC-20/721 tokens, DApps, protocol logic)
 - Exploring macroeconomic shifts, governance models, and RWA/token utility
 - Starting builds on the SOL/RUST/ANCHOR system now as well
 - Publishing dev logs, DeFi research, and token analysis at NewWorldCryptos.io
 - Preparing to relaunch NewWorldCryptos.com — our paused consulting and onboarding hub — after completing advanced blockchain studies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
