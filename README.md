# 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene McGrath  
**Blockchain Developer | Educator | Consultant | Writer | Researcher | Co-Founder & Co-CEO of New World Cryptos® | U.S. Army Veteran**

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack blockchain developer, writer, and researcher focused on decentralized infrastructure, smart contracts, and financial sovereignty.

As Co-Founder and Co-CEO of New World Cryptos® — launched in 2021 and registered with the USPTO in 2024 — I co-lead a dual-platform initiative dedicated to blockchain education and Web3 innovation. While I now drive development and research efforts, the platform’s creation, design, and brand identity were led by my partner and co-founder, The Decentralized Dreamer, who architected both sites from the ground up.

Our two platforms include:
- [**NewWorldCryptos.io**](https://newworldcryptos.io) — a self-hosted Ghost publication for dev logs, crypto research, and sovereign signal
- [**NewWorldCryptos.mn.co**](https://newworldcryptos.mn.co) — our original community and consulting site (currently paused)

I work hands-on with Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, Rust/Anchor, and related tooling — blending code with market research to publish high-context insights for sovereign builders.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 Current Focus

 - Publishing dev logs, DeFi research, and token analysis at NewWorldCryptos.io
 - Building Solidity-based projects (ERC-20/721 tokens, DApps, protocol logic)
 - Exploring macroeconomic shifts, governance models, and RWA/token utility
 - Preparing to relaunch NewWorldCryptos.mn.co — our paused consulting and onboarding hub — after completing advanced blockchain studies
 - Starting builds on the SOL/RUST/ANCHOR system now as well

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## 🚀 Featured Projects

 - 🧠 **New World Cryptos Journal** — Research, dev logs, smart contract experiments
- 🌐 **New World Cryptos PMA** — Community-first, sovereignty-based crypto consulting
- 💻 **GitHub Dev Work** — Web3 infrastructure, Solidity projects, Rust/Anchor builds
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## 📊 Market & Token Research

- **RWA Sector Deep Dives** (e.g., ONDO, Polymesh) with focus on utility and institutional backing  
- **Macro Trend Analysis**: Fed policy, BTC dominance, cycle shifts  
- **Hype Filtering**: Comparing high-risk projects using a fundamentals-first lens

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## 🔍 Research Philosophy

**No hype. No noise. Just signal.**  
I focus on real-world utility, code clarity, and on-chain transparency — building toward a freer, decentralized future.
